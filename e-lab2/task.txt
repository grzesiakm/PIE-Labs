# Flight simulator.
# Write a code in python that simulates the tilt correction of the plane (angle between plane wings and earth). 
# The program should print out current orientation, and applied tilt correction. 	
# (Tilt is "Roll" in this diagram https://www.novatel.com/assets/Web-Phase-2-2012/Solution-Pages/AttitudePlane.png)
# The program should run in infinite loop, until user breaks the loop.
# Assume that plane orientation in every new simulation step is random angle with gaussian distribution (the planes is experiencing "turbulations").
# Hint: "random.gauss(0, 2*rate_of_correction)"
# With every simulation step the orentation should be corrected, applied and printed out.
# Try to expand your implementation as best as you can.
# Think of as many features as you can, and try implementing them.
